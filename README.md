## What is Evolution
Evolution is a game based on the evolution of a cell from just a cell body to a full fledge cell with organs. As the player progresses they will eat a combination of two different foods, the meat and the veg. As the player begins to eat a majority of either one of the types of food they will become either a predator or prey. Each of these phases have their own skill tree that the player can use to upgrade their cell and give them new organs/features. These new additions to the cell also improve the players attributes e.g. movement speed, vision. During the cells lifetime it will also come across a variety of different enemies which the player will have to safely navigate away from.
